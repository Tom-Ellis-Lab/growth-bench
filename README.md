# growth-bench
A set of tasks comparing machine learning and genome scale metabolic models on the task of predicting growth rates.

## Goal
We want to compare models in their accuracy of predicting growth rates. Thus, we need a standard implementation of different models, a set of datasets combining inputs and targets, and a set of tasks that the models are evaluated on.

## ToDos
- [ ] Search for datasets with growth rates
- [ ] Define interesting tasks to evaluate models on
  - [ ] What are current models predicting => let's define those as tasks
- [ ] Create a standardized way to access data
- [ ] Implement/Port models to work on the prepared datasets
- [ ] Add and evaluate additional models on the datasets
